# Hello Cargo
hello_world created with [Cargo](http://doc.crates.io/guide.html).

## Notes
- Can manually compile very simple projects with `$ rustc filename.rs`
- `$ cargo build` will compile for dev
- `$ cargo build --release` will compile for production (optimized code, longer compile time)
- Can generally get started with all existing Rust projects with
  ```
  $ git clone someurl.com/someproject
  $ cd someproject
  $ cargo build
  ```
